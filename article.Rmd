# RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESIS

<!-- Currently the intro is 350 words, just about OK! -->

<!-- The Covid-19 pandemic has transformed all sectors of the economy, not least transport. -->
<!-- [Demand for long distance trips has plummetted](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v3g5d/) and [airline companies have gone bust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08460) [@iacus_estimating_2020; @jittrapirom_exploratory_2020]. -->
Much attention has focused on the impacts of Covid-19 on long distance travel patterns [e.g. @iacus_estimating_2020; @jittrapirom_exploratory_2020].
Yet short distance travel patterns have also changed, with a notable uptick in active travel, particularly cycling, in some areas  [@harrabin_boom_2020].
The two main explanations for this are 1) the need increased need for exercise close to home during lockdowns for mental and physical health [@jimenez-pavon_physical_2020]; and 2) reduced public transport options and use [e.g. @tian_investigation_2020].
The second reason is particularly important given that many 'key workers' are low paid, with limited access to private automobiles.

<!-- due to cuts in services and fear of being infected while in enclosed spaces, meaning that walking and particularly cycling may be the only way that workers can reach key destinations such as hospitals. -->

<!-- From a physical activity perspective this change is welcome: obesity is a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality, including from Covid-19 [@docherty_features_2020]. -->
<!-- From a physical distancing perspective, increased levels of walking and cycling, -->
<!-- the shift creates pressure on governments to ensure sufficient 'space for social distancing', while enabling increased active mobility for health and travel to key workplaces. -->
<!-- particularly in densly populated urban areas where pavements and cycleways may be narrow,  -->

Local and national governments are working out how best to respond.
Many options are available to ensure that citizens can benefit from outdoor activity while minimizing health risks, ranging from the hand sanitiser provision to the creation of extra active transport space [@freeman_covid19_2020].
Installation of 'pop-up' active transport infrastructure has been endorsed and implemented in many places [@laker_world_2020].
The Scottish government, for example, has provided £10m "to keep key workers moving" by "reallocating road space to better enable this shift and make it safer for people who choose to walk, cycle or wheel for essential trips or for exercise" [@transportscotland_10_2020].
Most pop-up active transport infrastructure can be classified into three broad categories:


1. 'filtered permeability', e.g. as [shown](https://twitter.com/CatrionaSwanson/status/1258322956595453952) in [@salfordcitycouncil_salford_2020]

2. banning cars and to pedestrianise streets, as in New York's 'Open Streets' scheme [@litman_pandemicresilient_2020]
3. the reallocation of one or more lanes on wide roads to create pop-up cycleways [@orsman_covid_2020]. 
<!-- interventions to prevent through traffic, with interventions as part of Salford's ['Liveable Streets' project](https://salfordliveablestreets.commonplace.is/) being a prominent example  -->
<!-- (see [here](https://twitter.com/CatrionaSwanson/status/1258322956595453952) for a photo illustrating this type of intervention) -->

The focus of this article is on the third category.
The research question is:

> How can automated data analysis and interactive visualisation methods help prioritise the reallocation of road space for pop-up active transport infrastructure?

Because of the recent, localised and often ad-hoc nature of pop-up infrastructure, it is difficult to make, let alone test, hypotheses related to the research question.
Our broad hypothesis is that digital tools based on open data, such as the interactive map used to support community-level responses to Covid-19 in Salford [@salfordcitycouncil_salford_2020], illustrated in Figure 1, can lead to more effective use of resources allocated to pop-up interventions.

```


 <!-- With the rush to act, there is a great need for evidence of *where* new interventions should be prioritised. As with the medical science, research is needed now. Methods developed to identify locations of high walking and cycling potential can help ensure that the ‘pop-up’ infrastructure that goes in now is effective, safe, and placed where it is most needed. -->

Three main datasets were used for the project:

- Estimates of cycling potential to work at the street segment level from the UK Department for Transport funded Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) project [@goodman_scenarios_2019; @lovelace_propensity_2017; @R-pct]
- Data derived from OpenStreetMap, with a number of new variables added to support cycling infrastructure planning (see www.cyipt.bike for an overivew)
- A list hospital locations from the UK's National Health Service website [www.nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/about-us/nhs-website-datasets/)
<!-- - Data on the location of road traffic casualties from -->

Datasets from the PCT and CyIPT project were merged, resulting in key variables summarised in Table 1.
A map showing the spatial distribution of hospitals in the case study city of Leeds is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hospitals).

<!-- Could say more about the case study city here if there is space -->

## Geographic subsetting

The region of analysis may seem like a basic consideration: most cities have well-defined administrative zones.
In Leeds and many other cities, it makes sense to focus on the region directly surrounding the city centre, in a kind of 'geographical triage' to omit from the analysis pop-up options in the outskirts and focus valuable attention on the routes that are most likely to serve the highest number of people.
We set a modifiable parameter `city_centre_buffer_radius` to 8km (5 miles) as a 'first pass' for the case study city of Leeds.
The results are shown 
However, there are various reasons why simply analysing and plotting all possible transport network segments within the city or regional boundaries may not be a good idea, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:gsub).

```{r gsub, fig.cap="Illustration of geographic subsetting based on distance to the city centre rather than based on location within somewhat arbitrarily shaped city boundaries"}
# nrow(r_central)
# nrow(rj)
square = stplanr::geo_bb(shp = city_centre_buffer)
m1 = tm_shape(r_main_region) +
  tm_lines("maxspeed", palette = "-Set1", lwd = "n_lanes_numeric", scale = 5,
           lwd.legend = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), title.lwd = "Number of lanes") +
  tm_shape(region) + tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(square) + tm_borders(lty = 3) +
  tm_scale_bar() 
# m1
m2 = tm_shape(r_main) +
  tm_lines("maxspeed", palette = "-Set1", lwd = "n_lanes_numeric", scale = 5,
           lwd.legend = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), title.lwd = "Number of lanes") +
  tm_shape(city_centre_buffer) + tm_borders() +
  tm_scale_bar() +
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE)
tmap_arrange(m1, m2, nrow = 1)
```


## Levels of analysis and grouping


An important distinction when developing methods for automated analysis of transport networks is the level of analysis.

```{r levels}
r_pct_lanes = rj %>% 
  filter(cycling_potential > min_cycling_potential) %>% 
  filter((lanespsvforward + lanesforward) > 1 |
      (lanespsvbackward + lanesbackward) > 1
  )
touching_list = st_touches(r_pct_lanes)
g = igraph::graph.adjlist(touching_list)
components = igraph::components(g)
r_pct_lanes$group = components$membership
r_pct_lanes = r_pct_lanes %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  mutate(group_length = sum(length)) %>% 
  mutate(cycling_potential_mean = mean(cycling_potential, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(cycling_potential_mean > min_grouped_cycling_potential)
r_pct_lanes = r_pct_lanes %>% filter(group_length > min_grouped_length)
r_filter_before_grouping = rj %>% 
  filter(cycling_potential > min_cycling_potential) %>% 
  filter((lanespsvforward + lanesforward) > 1 |
           (lanespsvbackward + lanesbackward) > 1
  ) %>% 
  filter(cycling_potential > min_grouped_cycling_potential) %>% 
  filter(length > 100)
tmap_mode("plot")
m1 = tm_shape(city_centre_buffer) + tm_borders(col = "grey") +
  tm_shape(r_filter_before_grouping) + tm_lines() +
  tm_layout(title = "Filter then group (length > 100, cycling_potential > 100)")
m2 = tm_shape(city_centre_buffer) + tm_borders(col = "grey") +
  tm_shape(r_pct_lanes) + tm_lines() +
  tm_layout(title = "Group then filter (length > 500, cycling_potential > 100)")
ma = tmap_arrange(m1, m2)

<!-- Guidance from https://transportfindings.org/for-authors -->

<!-- Transport Findings welcomes research findings in the broad field of transport. Articles must either pose a New Question,  present a New Method, employ New Data (including New Contexts or Locations),  discover a New Finding (i.e. it can almost exactly replicate a previous study and find something different), or some combination of the above. -->
<!-- Scope -->

<!-- You may find yourself asking if your paper is within the scope of Transport Findings. -->

<!--     Is there a hypothesis somehow related to transport? -->

<!-- Manuscript submissions may include SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION in separate files that do not count against article length. This information should not be essential for the general understanding of the manuscript. -->
<!-- Style -->
<!-- Focus and Parsimony -->

<!-- Papers should be focused and to the point, and not begin with trite observations like “Congestion is a problem the world over.” Usually you can delete your opening paragraph if it begins like that, and the reader is no worse off. As Strunk and White say: “Omit Needless Words”. The Abstract should not say the same thing as the Introduction. -->
<!-- Transparency and Replicability -->

<!-- A minimum standard for a good paper is transparency and replicability: Can the reader understand what you did, and repeat it, and get the same answer? -->
<!-- Mathematical Conventions -->

<!-- Each variable shall have one, and only one, definition per document. -->

<!-- Each defined term in the document shall be represented by one and only one variable. -->

<!-- Lowercase and uppercase versions of the same letter should be logically related. For instance, use lowercase letters to define the PDF (probability distribution function) or individual instance, and uppercase letters the CDF (cumulative distribution function) or population, so when you sum:  i=1 to I, k=1 to K, etc. -->

<!-- All variables shall be a single letter or symbol. Double or triple letter variables can be confused with multiplication. If you have more than 52 symbols in your paper (26 letters for both lower and upper case), consider (a) there are too many, and (b) using Greek or Hebrew characters. -->
