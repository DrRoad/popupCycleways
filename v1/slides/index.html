### How to identify ‘top ranked new cycleways’?

&lt;!-- ![](figures/results-top-leeds.png) --&gt;

- Aims to identify **short term priorities**
- All road sections with spare lanes or estimated width &gt; 10 m (CyIPT)
- Of those, which have a minum continuous length of at least 500 m?
- Rank the roads by cycling potential (commute + school, Government Target)
- Show the top n, where n depends on the size of the region (70 in London)

### How to identify a ‘cohesive network’?

- Aims to support **long term planning**
- Intended to show what a joined-up cycle network could look like if we were to consider new cycleways by either closing roads to motorised traffic or creating one-way systems
- Find  roads that have high cycling potential on some or all of their length
- Join them up

# How should I use these results?

- Aim: to support evidence-based prioritisation of bids for Tranche 2 of the Emergency Active Travel Fund
- Complementing local knowledge and stakeholder engagement
- Scoping of options
- Order of implementations

Investment should depend on many factors including:

- cycling potential (default metric to rank schemes)
- total length of cycling infrastructure created
- cycling potential multiplied by road section length

## Limitations

- Narrow focus on road space reallocation options
- No economic appraisal
  - Use the Active Mode Appraisal Toolkit ([AMAT](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tag-social-and-distributional-impacts-worksheets)) 
- The best locations for new cycleways may not always have space
  - Search for parallel routes, which may be available
- Many options not in top routes
  - see cohesive network and look for other option
- The road network data is from 2017 and widths are estimates
  - Compare with real world knowledge
- Only work and school trips included
  - Use local knowledge of new developments and other 'trip attractors
- Prioritises routes in large cities in authorities with multiple settlements
  - Use alternative sources of information, including the PCT
  - Do additional analysis, e.g. based on data downloaded from the Rapid tool or the PCT

## Where can I find further information about the tool?

- See the technical specification [here](https://github.com/cyipt/popupCycleways/releases/download/v1/report.pdf)

Data about the tools informing the model can be found here:

- The [Propensity to Cycle Tool](https://www.pct.bike/)
- The [Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Tool](https://www.cyipt.bike)
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/52.486/-2.428&amp;layers=C)

- Code underlying the project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/cyipt/popupCycleways).
- Support the project with technical input via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/cyipt/popupCycleways/issues/14)
- Data generated by the project can be downloaded from GitHub (e.g. see GeoJSON files for London [here](https://github.com/cyipt/popupCycleways/tree/gh-pages/v1/greater-london)).
