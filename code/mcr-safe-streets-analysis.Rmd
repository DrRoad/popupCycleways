# Context

## Public transport

Greater Manchester has high cycling potential and high reliance on public transport (PT) .
Across the region overall, 14.3% of commutes were made by public transport in 2011, although the reliance on public transport varies substantially across the region.
Around a third of trips are made by PT in many parts of Manchester and Salford, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pt).
These areas areas that are particularly vulnerable to reduced capacity by public transport also tend to be within cycling distance from the main employment centre in Manchester's city centre.

```{r pt, fig.cap="The percentage of trips made by public transport. Source: 2011 Census"}
tm_shape(z) + tm_fill("pt_2011", palette = "Blues", title = "% PT (2011)") +
  tm_shape(lads) + tm_borders(col = "black") + tm_text("lad_name") +
  tm_scale_bar()
```

## Active transport

The geographic distribution of active transport (walking and cycling) for commuting is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:active).
13% of single mode commutes were made by active modes in 2011.
This has the potential to more than double to 33% for the region overall under the Ebikes scenario, represented in Figure \@ref(fig:activedutch).

```{r active, fig.cap="Percentage of commutes in Greater Manchester by active transport. Source: 2011 Census"}
tm_shape(z) + tm_fill("active_2011", palette = "Greens", title = "% Active (2011)", breaks = b) +
  tm_shape(lads) + tm_borders(col = "black") + tm_text("lad_name") +
  tm_scale_bar()
# (sum(z$foot) + sum(z$bicycle)) / sum(z$all)
# (sum(z$foot) + sum(z$dutch_slc)) / sum(z$all)
```

The majority of potential growth in active transport comes from cycling due to the increased range of commutes by this mode, around 5 km for most people and further for many, due to high fitness and use of e-bikes.



```{r activedutch, fig.cap="Percentage of commutes in Greater Manchester by active transport under the Ebikes scenario. Source: Propensity to Cycle Tool"}
tm_shape(z) + tm_fill("active_dutch", palette = "Greens", title = "% Active (Ebikes)", breaks = b) +
  tm_shape(lads) + tm_borders(col = "black") + tm_text("lad_name") +
  tm_scale_bar()
```

Like surrounding regions, only 2% of single mode commutes in were made by bike according to data from the 2011 Census (this figure will be higher, perhaps doubling since the introduction of pro-cycling policies since 2011 and the uptake of cycling in response to PT capacity restrictions).

Under the Ebikes scenario, this rises to 22%, compared with 20% in Lancashire and Cheshire, with a geographic distribution shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cycling).
The region has high cycling potential because of the high population density in the region and relatively short average trip distances.

```{r cycling, fig.cap="Mode share of cycling from the 2011 Census and under the Ebikes scenario in the Propensity to Cycle Tool", out.width="50%", fig.show='hold'}

))
```

# Corridor analysis

We constrained the analysis to 10 key corridors.
These provide access to the main employment hub from the North, East, South and West, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:corridors).

```

To further focus the analysis, only the sections within 8 km of Manchester city centre were included.
The results of clipping key corridors to an 8 km buffer surrounding the city centre are shown in the Figure \@ref(fig:buff8).

# Cycling potential on key corridors

The cycling potential under the E-bike scenario was assessed as follows:

```{r}
key_corridors_mcr_grouped2 = key_corridors8 %>% 
  # group_by(name, ref) %>%
  group_by(ref) %>%
  summarise(
    name = first(name),
    cycling_potential = round(mean(cycling_potential)),
    width = round(mean(width)),
    length = round(sum(length))
    ) %>% 
  ungroup()

key_corridors_mcr_grouped2 %>% 
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  group_by(ref) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Length (m)` = round(sum(length)),
    `Cycling potential` = mean(cycling_potential),
    `Width (m)` = mean(width),
    `Km/day` = round(`Length (m)` * `Cycling potential` / 1000) * 2
    ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Km/day`)) %>% 
  filter(`Length (m)` > 2000) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Average cycling potential, width and potential distance cycled per day for commuting (to and from work on a typical work day) for each corridor under the Ebikes scenario.")
```

Many of the key corridors have spare lanes during times of low traffic, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:nlanes), which also shows the variability of cycling potential in segments along the different corridors.


```{r nlanes, fig.cap="Illustration of spare lanes on key corridors"}
# find the r_pct_lanes in the key roads
key_corridors_buffer = stplanr::geo_buffer(key_corridors8, dist = 20)
r_pct_lanes_in_corridors = r_pct_lanes_all[key_corridors_buffer, , op = sf::st_within]
m = tm_shape(key_corridors8) +
  tm_lines(lwd = "cycling_potential", scale = 9, alpha = 0.8, col = "ref") +
  tm_shape(r_pct_lanes_in_corridors) + tm_lines() +
  tm_scale_bar()
m
```




```{r}
l = readRDS("mcr-l-pct.Rds")
r = readRDS("mcr-r-pct.Rds")


# potential analysis ------------------------------------------------------

r$pt_mode_shift = r$ebike_sip * -1
# summary(r$pt_mode_shift)
# nrow(r) # 16363
# rnet_pt = stplanr::overline(r, "pt_mode_shift")
# saveRDS(rnet_pt, "mcr-rnet_pt.Rds")
# mapview::mapview(rnet_pt)
rnet_pt = readRDS("mcr-rnet_pt.Rds")

# since 2011 there has been a doubling


# high percentage of key workers - stats


```

Cycling potential can also be estimated in terms of the number of new cycling trips that could result from a mode shift to cycling.
Results of the shift from PT under the E-bikes scenario, which were calculated at the route segment level for the first time in this study, are shown for each key corridor in Figure \@ref(fig:shift):

```{r shift, fig.cap="Cycling potential associated with a PT/cycling mode shift under the Ebikes scenario at the route network level within 500 m of each corridor, under the (unmet) assumption that every mode has equal chance of being replaced by cycling for a given origin-destination pair. In practice, the probability of a trip being replaced by cycling is mode and context-dependent, with physical distancing rules making a PT/cycling switch proportionally more likely."}
key_corridors_buffer_100 = stplanr::geo_buffer(key_corridors8, dist = 500)
# slow operation:
rnet_pt_in_corridors = rnet_pt[key_corridors_buffer_100, , op = sf::st_within]
# saveRDS(rnet_pt_in_corridors, "rnet_pt_in_corridors.Rds")
# rnet_pt_in_corridors = readRDS("rnet_pt_in_corridors.Rds")
plot(rnet_pt_in_corridors)
# mapview::mapview(rnet_pt_in_corridors)
```

The results from this dataset will be used to assess cycling potential from a PT perspective, with results shown below.


```{r}
key_corridors_pt = st_join(rnet_pt_in_corridors, key_corridors_buffer["ref"])
key_corridors_pt$km_day = key_corridors_pt$pt_mode_shift * as.numeric(sf::st_length(key_corridors_pt)) / 1000
res_pt_corridors = key_corridors_pt %>% 
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  group_by(ref) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Km/day` = sum(km_day)
  )
res_pt_corridors %>%
  filter(!is.na(ref)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Km/day`)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 0, caption = "Ranking of corridors according to estimated distance of PT trips that switch to cycling within a 500m buffer of each corridor.")
# key_corridors_pt = aggregate(rnet_pt_in_corridors, key_corridors_buffer, op = sf::st_within, FUN = mean)
# key_corridors_pt %>%
