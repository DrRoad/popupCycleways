# Introduction

New statutory guidance and funding for active transport infrastructure was announced by the Secretary of State for Transport on May 9^th^, to support the UK's response to the COVID-19 crisis by enabling healthy and safe travel at a time of reduced capacity on public transport networks.^[
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities/traffic-management-act-2004-network-management-in-response-to-covid-19
]

The statutory guidance on network management in response to COVID-19 outlines a range of measures that can support a safe and healthy restart, including the creation of new cycleways, reducing speed limits, widening of footways and closing roads to motor traffic via 'modal filters'.
**This report describes the rapid cycleway prioritisation tool project, which provides aims to ensure evidence-based and effective investment in first of these measures: the creation of new cycleways in existing carriageway space reclaimed from motor traffic.**
Light segregation infrastructure such as flexible plastic wands (illustrated in Figure 1) and bollards can deliver a step change in provision for cycling, when implemented in combination with other measures such reduced speed limits on key corridors (as has happened on the A33 in Southampton and the A56 in Manchester) and when placed where they are most needed.
**The purpose of the tool is to help identify such key corridors, ensuring that funds from the Emergency Active Travel Fund change the status quo of city transport systems in favour of active travel.**

The £250m released by the Emergency Active Travel Fund will be spent in three broad ways:

- The first tranche: £45m released on 1^st^ June, is for swift interventions that must be implemented by the end of June
- The second tranche: £180m will be released later in the summer for more permanent measures
- £25m will be invested in cycle repair schemes

The emphasis of the evidence presented in this report is providing a strong evidence base to prioritisation of schemes eligible for the second tranche.
However, the evidence could also be used to support identification of schemes for the first tranche, such as reallocation of road space on arterial routes, where decisions have not yet been made.

Given the importance of acting quickly, and the unique opportunity that the crisis poses to improve physical activity levels in the long term, it is vital that local authorities have the evidence they need.
Without a nationally consistent and systematic evidence base, there is a risk that some already stretched local authorities will rely on ad-hoc methods to allocate funding.
The rapid cycleway prioritisation tool can also support authorities to make bold plans by highlighting the potential of key strategic corridors.

# Methods

The approach was designed to identify roads and road segments where investment in new cycleways should be prioritised using a transparent methodology and nationally consistent datasets, alongside local authority expertise and local knowledge.
Strong and actionable datasets already exist to support strategic cycle network planning, notably the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), a national planning support system [@lovelace_propensity_2017].
The PCT is already used by local authorities and contains key data showing not only current levels of cycling but also scenarios of growth, notably the Government Target scenario of doubling the number of cycling stages made by 2025 [@departmentfortransport_cycling_2017], at area, route and route network levels, for commuting and school travel (as of May 2020) [@goodman_scenarios_2019].
A limitation of the PCT, however, is that it takes little account of existing infrastructure: variables such as road width and even the presence/absence of cycle infrastructure currently are not included in the results.

To address this limitation, the work set out below will use national road network data which includes geographic attributes and cycle infrastructure from OpenStreetMap, plus carriageway width data derived from analysis of Ordnance Survey data.
This road data was developed for the Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Tool (CyIPT) project, funded as a prototype project by a DfT Transport-technology research innovation grants (T-TRIG).
The results of CyIPT, while not publicly accessible, are well known among local authority transport planners and are reported to be of great use to practitioners in scheme prioritisation, according to a DfT funded Discovery project on tools to support investment in active transport.^[

]

The rapid cycleway prioritisation tool is based on levels of cycling potential *and* road attribute data, with an emphasis on road space reallocation.
The method was parameterised to highlight roads that have sufficient space to allow for new cycleways without affecting the navigable network for motorised modes [@lovelace_methods_2020].
A key benefit of this method is that it allows continuous road sections to be identified and ranked, supporting prioritisation of investment, based not only on cycling potential, but also based on continuous road length and estimated cycle usage measured in km per day.
The tool highlights continuous road sections with high cycling potential in the context of existing infrastructure on the basis that new infrastructure should maximise cycle network cohesion and continuity [@parkin_designing_2018].

## Attribute filtering and grouping

At a time of reduced travel, fewer lanes dedicated to motor traffic are needed.
Based on this observation, we defined roads with a 'spare lane' as those on which there is more than one lane in either direction.
This definition assumes no reduction in mobility for motor vehicles (making two-way lanes one-way is another option not explored in this analysis).

To identify road sections on which there is a spare lane we developed a simple algorithm that takes the OSM variable [`lanes`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:lanes) if it is present and, if not, derives the number from the highway type and presence/absence of bus lanes.
All segments defined as having a spare lane using this method is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:levels) (left).
In future, this methodology could be enhanced to take into account the effect of lane widths, which increase the effective available space, and the presence of vehicle parking bays, which reduce it.
The result of filtering by distance and cycling potential before and after grouping using graph membership of touching roads is shown in \@ref(fig:levels) (middle and right, respectively).
Grouping linked roads before filtering results in a more cohesive network.

# Limitations and known issues


The approach is not without limitations.
Its reliance on data rather than community engagement represents a rather top-down approach to transport planning.
To overcome this issue, future work could seek to incorporate the results such as those presented above into a participatory map of the type shown in Figure 1.
