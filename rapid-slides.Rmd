1) reduced capacity on public transport 2) need for space so physical distancing guidelines can be followed
3) healthy restart 4) need to act fast

### Existing cycleways

- Aims to identify **immediate** issues
- From OpenStreetMap, March 2020
- Contains sections of variable quality
- Aim to highligh where gaps need to be filled

### How to identify â€˜top ranked new cyclewaysâ€™?

<!-- ![](figures/results-top-leeds.png) -->

- Aims to identify **short term priorities**
- All road sections with spare lanes or estimated width > 10 m (CyIPT)
- Of those, which have a minum continuous length of at least 500 m?
- Rank the roads by cycling potential (commute + school, Government Target)
- Show the top n, where n depends on the size of the region (70 in London)

Tablular results for Leeds

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="100%"}
res_leeds = sf::read_sf("https://www.cyipt.bike/rapid/west-yorkshire/top_routes.geojson")
res_table = res_leeds %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_cycling_potential))
# %>% 
#   select(
#     Name = name,
#     Reference = ref,
#     `Length (m)` = group_length,
#     `Cycling potential` = mean_cycling_potential,
#     `Length * potential (km)` = km_cycled,
#     # `SRN` = srn,
#     `Speed limit` = speed_limit,
#     `Mean estimated width (m)` = mean_width,
#     `Majority spare lane(s)?` = majority_spare_lane

### How to identify a â€˜cohesive networkâ€™?

- Aims to support **long term planning**
- Intended to show what a joined-up cycle network could look like if we were to consider new cycleways by either closing roads to motorised traffic or creating one-way systems
- Find  roads that have high cycling potential on some or all of their length
- Join them up
