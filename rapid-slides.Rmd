<!-- 14h30-15h30 lecture part (this could already drift towards the practical part but doesn't have to ...) -->

<!-- 15:30-16h00 coffee break -->

<!-- 16h00-17h00 hands-on workshop (could be somewhat open-ended, we'll have the room all afternoon - but if we would go into extra time, we should make a short 'cut' around 17h such that those who have/want to go home can do so). -->

<!-- Sally: see it as an opportunity - vital for change -->

<!-- Lucy: Propensity to cycle tool -->

<!-- It's brilliant, magic, helps imagine what the future could be like -->

1) reduced capacity on public transport 2) need for space so physical distancing guidelines can be followed
3) healthy restart 4) need to act fast

### How to cope with reduced public transport capacity post COVID-19?

Plans from Leeds City Council responding to national [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities) and [funding](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2-billion-package-to-create-new-era-for-cycling-and-walking) for 'pop-up' cycleways:

## Spatial networks can support planning

### Transport networks are spatial networks

Every city in England

Results in Leeds:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
res_leeds = sf::read_sf("https://www.cyipt.bike/rapid/west-yorkshire/top_routes.geojson")
res_leeds %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_cycling_potential)) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  dplyr::select(name) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```

## Ingredients to prioritise transport infrastructure

.left-column[

- Current travel patterns
- Road attribute data 
- Potential usage levels
- Impact on overall network

**Spatial networks can help, especially with the last two**
