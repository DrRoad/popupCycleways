1) reduced capacity on public transport 2) need for space so physical distancing guidelines can be followed
3) healthy restart 4) need to act fast

Plans from Leeds City Council responding to national [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities) and [funding](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2-billion-package-to-create-new-era-for-cycling-and-walking) for 'pop-up' cycleways:

### Existing cycleways

- Aims to identify **immediate** issues
- From OpenStreetMap, March 2020
- Contains sections of variable quality
- Aim to highligh where gaps need to be filled

### How to identify â€˜top ranked new cyclewaysâ€™?

<!-- ![](figures/results-top-leeds.png) -->

- Aims to identify **short term priorities**
- All road sections with spare lanes or estimated width > 10 m (CyIPT)
- Of those, which have a minum continuous length of at least 500 m?
- Rank the roads by cycling potential (commute + school, Government Target)
- Show the top n, where n depends on the size of the region (70 in London)

Tablular results for Leeds

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="100%"}
res_leeds = sf::read_sf("https://www.cyipt.bike/rapid/west-yorkshire/top_routes.geojson")
res_table = res_leeds %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_cycling_potential))
# %>% 
#   select(
#     Name = name,
#     Reference = ref,
#     `Length (m)` = group_length,
#     `Cycling potential` = mean_cycling_potential,
#     `Length * potential (km)` = km_cycled,
#     # `SRN` = srn,
#     `Speed limit` = speed_limit,
#     `Mean estimated width (m)` = mean_width,
#     `Majority spare lane(s)?` = majority_spare_lane
#     ) 
DT::datatable(res_table, height = 600)
```

### How to identify a â€˜cohesive networkâ€™?

- Aims to support **long term planning**
- Intended to show what a joined-up cycle network could look like if we were to consider new cycleways by either closing roads to motorised traffic or creating one-way systems
- Find  roads that have high cycling potential on some or all of their length
- Join them up

# How should I use these results?

- Aim: to support evidence-based prioritisation of bids for Tranche 2 of the Emergency Active Travel Fund
- Complementing local knowledge and stakeholder engagement
- Scoping of options
- Order of implementations

Investment should depend on many factors including:

- cycling potential (default metric to rank schemes)
- total length of cycling infrastructure created
- cycling potential multiplied by road section length

## Limitations

- Narrow focus on road space reallocation options
- No economic appraisal
  - Use the Active Mode Appraisal Toolkit ([AMAT](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tag-social-and-distributional-impacts-worksheets)) 
- The best locations for new cycleways may not always have space
  - Search for parallel routes, which may be available
- Many options not in top routes
  - see cohesive network and look for other option
- The road network data is from 2017 and widths are estimates
  - Compare with real world knowledge
- Only work and school trips included
  - Use local knowledge of new developments and other 'trip attractors
- Prioritises routes in large cities in authorities with multiple settlements
  - Use alternative sources of information, including the PCT
